# ML-Leadership-Hub

Creating a Google sites Hub for Multilingual Leadership, where we can keep information and resources needed by ML Leads in their day to day or Onboarding journey.

Based on the [Multilingual Team Leads Onboarding Guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12V-dLZGXmCv75rQfzYa31ueptYeYYpXEsdR4H5mzzlY/edit#gid=0) we
will build up a Google sites Hub for Leadership.
